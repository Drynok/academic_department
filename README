Academic Department is Drupal 7 subproject which will be a basis for building Drupal Academic Department Profile.

It is in active development now. To install it, use this way:

1) Navigate to Academic Department installation path
2) You will be prompted to install Drupal
3) After installation enable Backup and Migrate module
4) Restore last database backup using Backup and Migrate module (admin/config/system/backup_migrate/destination)

If you want to take part in the development of this project, please contact me, because we need to set the way of database synchronization. I appreciate professional web design contribution.
