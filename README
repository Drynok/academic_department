Academic Department is Drupal 7 subproject which will be a basis for building Drupal Academic Department Profile.

It is in active development now. To install it, use this way:

1) Extract project to your web server path
2) Restore database from dump in academic_department/sites/default/files/backups/

If you want to take part in the development of this project, please contact me, because we need to set the way of database synchronization. I appreciate professional web design contribution.
